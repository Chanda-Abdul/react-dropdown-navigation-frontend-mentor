## Overview

### The challenge
Your challenge is to build out this intro section with dropdown navigation and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- [x] View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- [x] View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- [x] See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### What I learned
<!-- 
Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('🎉')
}
``` -->


### Continued development

- animations
- `href` navigation
- `aria` attributes and accessiblility

### Useful resources

- [Responsive Background Images Using React Hooks🍍](https://itnext.io/responsive-background-images-using-react-hooks-941af365ea1f) => This helped me responsively render images based on the current device breakpoint.
- [CSS Overlay Techniques](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/11/07/css-overlay-techniques/) => to add overlay to all other content while the mobile dropdown menu is open
